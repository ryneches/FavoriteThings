### [`sshuttle`](https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

If you have ssh access to a machine with a trusted network connection, 
`sshuttle` lets you use it as a VPN exit gateway for your local machine.
As long as the remote machine has a python interpreter, you don't need
to install or configure anything on it.
