# FavoriteThings

When I find something awesome and useful on the internets, I often find
that I don't want to close the browser tab for fear of forgetting that
my new discovery exists. This repo exists mostly to help me address my
browser-tab-anxiety, but everything on this list really is pretty awesome.

## Software

### [`sshuttle`](https://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

If you have ssh access to a machine with a trusted network connection, 
`sshuttle` lets you use it as a VPN exit gateway for your local machine.
As long as the remote machine has a python interpreter, you don't need
to install or configure anything on it.

### [`gzipstream`](https://github.com/commoncrawl/gzipstream)

Streaming I/O from gzipped data sources. Comes in handy when working with
huge text-like data files.

### [The Knowledge Repo](https://airbnb.io/projects/knowledge-repo/)

A tool for organizing Jupyter notebooks and MarkDown documents into a
bare-bones peer reviewed journal.

### [Jupyter Renderers](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers)

Renderers to display various types of output in Jupyter notebooks. My 
particular favorite is the FASTA viewer, which serves as a pretty-OK
viewer for DNA, RNA and protein alignments.

### [Jupyter Themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes)

I spend a lot of time in Jupyter notebooks. Themes are fun, but they are
also an effective way to avoid eyestrain and address other ergonomic
issues.

## Data

### [WorldClim](http://worldclim.org/)

A map dataset of several bioclimactic variables at about 1km resolution.
